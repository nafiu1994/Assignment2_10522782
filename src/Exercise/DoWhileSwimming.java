Q1
Ans: GALLANT swims for 3 mins but GOOFUS swims for  4 mins
Q2
Ans: GALLANT swims for 0 mins and GOOFUS swims for 1 min
Q3    
Ans: Gallant checks the water temperature first before he dives in the water.
Q4
Ans: Goofus dives in the water first before checking the water temperature.
Q5
Ans: In the "do-while" loop the statements are executed once before the test is made 
     but the while loop performs the tests first before execution of the statements.
Q6
Ans: The "do-while" loop is called a "pre-test loop" and the "while" loop is called a "post-test loop".
